# ðŸš€ HandyMany -  A Labor Hiring Platform

A real-time labor hiring platform designed to bridge the gap between clients and skilled workers â€” such as electricians, plumbers, carpenters, and more â€” in their immediate locality.

This platform works on a hybrid job dispatch model inspired by ride-hailing and food delivery apps like Ola, Uber, and Zomato, ensuring fast and reliable labor availability even in urgent scenarios.

Whether it's an emergency plumbing need, furniture installation, or electrical work, clients can quickly request help, and nearby available professionals get notified in real time. The entire flow â€” from OTP-based login to worker matching and notifications â€” is fully automated and production-grade.
